                    <p>I am passionate about helping people in whatever their specific need is.</p>
                    <p>To that point, I strive to make sure the people around me are not just succeeding, but excelling. Working on the Customer Success team at LinkedIn is a perfect pairing of my 1) desire to help people and 2) interest in understanding how things work from a technical perspective.</p>
                    <p>I have both seen and experienced how a dream job, which seems to be perfectly catered for a person's experience and personality, can affect their entire life. And, it is my privilege to be able to say that I get to be an aid / advocate / educator / advisor / enabler for the recruiters that change people's lives every day.</p>
